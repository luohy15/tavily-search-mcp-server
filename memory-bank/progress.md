# Progress: Tavily Search MCP Server

## What Works
- **Core Functionality**: The basic Tavily Search MCP Server works with both stdio and SSE transports
- **API Integration**: Integration with the Tavily Search API is functional
- **Tool Registration**: The tavily_search tool is properly registered and handled
- **Local Deployment**: The server can be run locally using Node.js
- **Docker Deployment**: The server can be run in a Docker container
- **Cloudflare Worker Implementation**: Basic implementation of the worker.ts file with proper error handling

## What's Left to Build
- **Wrangler Configuration**: Set up the necessary configuration for deployment
- **Build Process**: Establish a build process for the Worker
- **Deployment Documentation**: Document the deployment process
- **Testing**: Test the Worker implementation against the original

## Current Status
- **Project Stage**: Development
- **Implementation Status**: Worker implementation in progress, fixed hanging Promise issue
- **Documentation Status**: In progress
- **Deployment Status**: Not yet deployed to Cloudflare

## Known Issues
- **Express Compatibility**: Express is not directly compatible with Cloudflare Workers
- **SSE Implementation**: The current SSE implementation may need significant changes
- **Connection Management**: Workers have different connection management than Node.js
- **Environment Variables**: Need to be configured differently in Workers
- ~~**Durable Object ID Generation**: Fixed issue with invalid Durable Object IDs by using idFromName() instead of idFromString()~~
- ~~**SSE Message Handling**: Enhanced to send responses directly through the SSE connection when messages are received~~
- ~~**Session Persistence**: Improved session ID handling to maintain connection state across requests~~

## Milestones
