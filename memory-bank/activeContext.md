# Active Context: Tavily Search MCP Server

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on deploying the SSE implementation of the Tavily Search MCP Server as a Cloudflare Worker. This involves adapting the existing Express-based SSE implementation to work within the Cloudflare Workers environment.

## Recent Changes
- Initial project setup with both stdio and SSE transport implementations
- Documentation of the project structure and architecture
- Analysis of requirements for Cloudflare Workers deployment
- Fixed hanging Promise issue in the Cloudflare Worker implementation
- Improved error handling and connection management in the worker.ts file
- Fixed "Invalid Durable Object ID" error by using idFromName() instead of idFromString() with UUIDs
- Enhanced SSE message handling to send responses directly through the SSE connection
- Improved session ID handling to maintain connection state across requests

## Active Decisions

### Cloudflare Workers Implementation Approach
We need to decide on the best approach for implementing the SSE functionality in Cloudflare Workers:

1. **Complete Rewrite**: Create a new implementation specifically for Workers
   - Pros: Optimized for Workers environment, no compatibility issues
   - Cons: Duplicate code, maintenance overhead

2. **Adaptation Layer**: Create an adapter that translates between Express and Workers
   - Pros: Reuses existing code, easier maintenance
   - Cons: Potential performance overhead, complexity

3. **Minimal Modification**: Make targeted changes to the existing code
   - Pros: Simpler implementation, less code change
   - Cons: May miss edge cases, potential compatibility issues

**Decision**: We will pursue the Minimal Modification approach, making targeted changes to adapt the existing code to the Workers environment while maintaining the core functionality.

### Environment Variable Handling
We need to decide how to handle the Tavily API key in the Workers environment:

1. **Environment Variables**: Use Cloudflare Workers' environment variables
   - Pros: Secure, follows best practices
   - Cons: Requires additional configuration

2. **Wrangler Secret**: Use Wrangler's secret management
   - Pros: Secure, integrated with deployment
   - Cons: Requires Wrangler CLI setup

**Decision**: We will use Cloudflare Workers' environment variables, configured through Wrangler, to store the Tavily API key.

## Next Steps

1. **Create Worker Implementation**:
   - Adapt the SSE implementation to use Workers' fetch event handlers
   - Modify the SSE transport to work with Workers' streaming responses
   - Ensure compatibility with the MCP SDK in the Workers environment

2. **Set Up Wrangler Configuration**:
   - Create wrangler.toml file
   - Configure environment variables
   - Set up appropriate routes

3. **Develop Deployment Process**:
   - Create build scripts for the Worker
   - Document deployment steps
   - Test the deployment process

4. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Test the Worker implementation
   - Validate functionality against the original implementation
   - Ensure proper error handling and edge cases

## Current Considerations

### Technical Considerations
- Cloudflare Workers have different runtime characteristics than Node.js
- Express is not directly compatible with Workers
- SSE implementation needs to be adapted for Workers' streaming responses
- Workers have execution time limits that may affect long-lived connections

### Integration Considerations
- The Worker needs to maintain compatibility with existing MCP clients
- Authentication and API key management need to be secure
- Error handling and logging need to be adapted for the Workers environment

### Deployment Considerations
- Wrangler configuration needs to be set up correctly
- Environment variables need to be configured
- Routes need to be defined
- Build process needs to be established
