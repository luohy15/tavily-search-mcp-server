# Product Context: Tavily Search MCP Server

## Why This Project Exists
The Tavily Search MCP Server exists to bridge the gap between Large Language Models (LLMs) and real-time web information. LLMs like Claude have knowledge cutoffs and cannot directly access the internet. This MCP server provides a standardized way for LLMs to perform web searches and retrieve up-to-date information from the internet.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Knowledge Recency**: Overcomes LLM knowledge cutoffs by providing access to current information
2. **Information Retrieval**: Enables LLMs to search for specific information not in their training data
3. **Verification**: Allows LLMs to verify facts and claims against current web sources
4. **Research Capability**: Enhances LLMs' ability to perform research on behalf of users
5. **Integration Standardization**: Provides a consistent interface for LLMs to access search functionality

## How It Should Work
1. The LLM sends a search query with optional parameters through the MCP interface
2. The server forwards the request to the Tavily Search API with appropriate authentication
3. Tavily performs the search and returns optimized results
4. The server processes and formats these results
5. The LLM receives the formatted search results and can use them to inform its responses

## User Experience Goals
1. **Seamless Integration**: The search capability should feel like a natural extension of the LLM's abilities
2. **Relevant Results**: Search results should be highly relevant to the query
3. **Efficient Information Extraction**: Results should be formatted in a way that makes it easy for LLMs to extract and use the information
4. **Configurability**: Advanced users should be able to fine-tune search parameters
5. **Reliability**: The service should be highly available and respond quickly

## Deployment Context
Deploying the SSE implementation as a Cloudflare Worker will provide:
1. **Global Distribution**: Low-latency access from anywhere in the world
2. **Scalability**: Automatic scaling to handle varying loads
3. **Reliability**: High uptime and fault tolerance
4. **Cost Efficiency**: Pay-per-request pricing model
5. **Simplified Operations**: No server management overhead
